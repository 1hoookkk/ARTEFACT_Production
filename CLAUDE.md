This file provides authoritative guidance to Claude Code when working with the SpectralCanvas Pro repository. All user prompts must operate within these boundaries.

Project Overview

SpectralCanvas Pro is a JUCE-based audio plugin and standalone application for spectral synthesis and canvas-driven sound design.

Phase 1 (MVP): Core Paint‚ÜíAudio pipeline, real-time synthesis

Phase 2 (Current): UI upgrade per ui-phase2-scoped-spec.md ("Minimal but Musical")

Phase 3+: Advanced 3D features (future roadmap, not current scope)

Repository Structure

Source/Core/ ‚Üí DSP engine, RT-safe systems

Source/GUI/ ‚Üí Editor + Phase 2 UI components

Source/Spectral/ ‚Üí STFT, HPSS, spectral analysis

Source/Tests/ ‚Üí Unit tests integrated with main build

Tests/ ‚Üí Standalone integration tests

docs/ ‚Üí Specs, design notes (ui-phase2-scoped-spec.md)

External/JUCE/ ‚Üí JUCE framework (external)

build/ ‚Üí Build artifacts (read-only)

Core Architecture

Paint‚ÜíAudio Pipeline: Lock-free SPSC queue from UI to audio thread

RT-Safe Audio: No locks/allocations on audio thread

Parameter Management: APVTS with atomic snapshots

Emergency Systems: Test tone injection

Analog Filter Chain: Tube + EMU-style filtering

Development Guidelines

Language & Style:

C++17, JUCE conventions

RAII and smart pointers; no raw new/delete

Thread-safe: no allocations/locks on audio thread

Doxygen-style headers for public classes/functions

Testing:

All DSP changes require unit + RT-safety tests (Source/Tests/)

UI behavior validated with integration tests (Tests/)

Docs:

Major features require update to /docs/

UI changes must sync with ui-phase2-scoped-spec.md

Commands
Build
# Build with tests
cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo --target ALL_BUILD

Test
# Run all tests
ctest --test-dir build -C RelWithDebInfo --output-on-failure
# Run RT-safety subset
ctest --test-dir build -C RelWithDebInfo -R "RT|Paint|Audio" --output-on-failure

Dev Workflow
# Emergency test tone toggle (Editor: press 'T')
# Continuous TDD
tdd-guard.bat
# Quick build validation
tools/test/phase7-quick-validation.bat

File Boundaries

Editable: Source/**, Tests/**, docs/**, CMakeLists.txt

Protected: CLAUDE.md, .claude/*.json, .git/**

Read-Only: External/JUCE/**, build/**, **/obj/**

Workflow: RECON ‚Üí SPEC ‚Üí PATCH ‚Üí VERIFY

RECON: Reader-agent gathers evidence

SPEC: Main agent confirms requirements

PATCH: Maker-agent applies unified diffs

VERIFY: User builds/tests to confirm

Agent Delegation

reader-agent (haiku): file reads, searches, evidence gathering

maker-agent (opus/sonnet): code generation, patches, build commands

Always parallelize when safe (multi-agent strategy)

Permissions & Safety Modes

Default: Plan Mode ON (Shift+Tab twice) for analysis before edits

Auto-Accept: Allowed for Edit(*) and Grep(*) during Phase 2 UI iteration

Forbidden: --dangerously-skip-permissions (never use)

Conflict Resolution

User directives (highest priority)

CLAUDE.md rules

Default safe practices

Phase 2 UI Rules (Scoped Spec)

When editing Source/GUI/**, changes must follow docs/ui-phase2-scoped-spec.md:

Canvas: Flat 2D spectrogram, additive glow strokes, cyan/orange HPSS system

Overlays: Note grid, piano roll, scale highlighting, ghost snapping

Feedback: Overtone guides, chord recognition

Export Pod: Real-time waveform preview + drag-to-DAW export

Notifications & Hooks (Pushover)

## Tooling
- Primary notifier: PowerShell script at .claude/hooks/pushover-notifier.ps1
- Call pattern:
  powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .claude/hooks/pushover-notifier.ps1 "<message>" -Title "<title>" -Priority "<0-2>"
- Configuration: C:\Users\hooki\.claude\pushover.json with Pushover API credentials
- Never call curl directly; always use the notifier script.

## Permissions
- Allowed: Bash(powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .claude/hooks/pushover-notifier.ps1 *)
- Disallowed: arbitrary network calls for notifications.

## When to notify (MANDATORY - send for ALL events)
- After successful build: "üì¶ Build complete" (+ target name, duration if available)
- After tests pass: "‚úÖ Tests passed" (+ duration, changed file count)  
- After multi-file edit sessions > 3 files: "üéâ Task completed" (+ file count)
- After PR create/merge: "üöÄ PR <id> <action>"
- Before launching applications: "üöÄ Launching <app-name>"
- After application launches successfully: "‚úÖ <app-name> started"
- On any failure: "‚ùå <event> failed: <one-line reason>"
- When completing any significant task: "‚úÖ <task-name> completed"
- **ALWAYS notify immediately after any build, test, or launch command completes**

## CI/CD (optional)
- If CI is detected, add a final step that runs the notifier with job status.

## Plan Mode for first-time wiring
- For initial setup changes (hooks, CI edits), use Plan Mode and show diffs before executing.

No deviation from spec without explicit user approval.
