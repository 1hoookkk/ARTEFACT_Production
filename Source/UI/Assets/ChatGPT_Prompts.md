## üîÑ ITERATION STRATEGY

1. **Start with base prompts** above
2. **Generate 3-4 variations** of each element  
3. **Use refinement prompts** to adjust specific aspects
4. **Test different angles** for knobs (0¬∞, 15¬∞, 30¬∞)
5. **Vary content** for LCD displays (different text/values)
6. **Create state variations** (active/inactive, different levels)

## üí° TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS

- **Copy entire prompt** including all descriptors for consistency
- **Generate multiple variations** before moving to next element
- **Use specific measurements** when possible (approximately X pixels)
- **Maintain EMU Audity style keywords** in every prompt
- **Request "high-resolution"** to ensure quality for Magnific upscaling
- **Specify viewing angles** clearly for 3D elements like knobs
- **Include material descriptions** (brushed metal, matte LCD, etc.)
