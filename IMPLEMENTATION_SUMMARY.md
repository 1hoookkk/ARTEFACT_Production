## üé® Claude Code Integration

### Common Issues Addressed
| AI Issue | Detection | Auto-Fix |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Memory allocation in audio thread | Pattern matching | Pre-allocation suggestion |
| Windows header pollution | Include order analysis | Reorder includes |
| Blocking operations in RT code | Function call detection | Atomic operation suggestion |
| Raw pointer usage | Type analysis | Smart pointer conversion |
| Exception handling in audio | Try/catch detection | Error code recommendation |

### Workflow for AI-Assisted Development
1. AI generates code
2. Quality system automatically scans
3. Issues are classified and routed
4. Fixes are suggested or auto-applied
5. Integration tests verify safety
6. Build system validates changes
