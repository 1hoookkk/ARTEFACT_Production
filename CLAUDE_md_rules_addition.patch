Add missing RULE memories to CLAUDE.md:

Lines to add after line 298:
- # RULE: Simple Loop v5.0 only — RECON → SPEC → PATCH (diff-only) → VERIFY (ctest)
- # RULE: Only reader-agent and maker-agent. No new agents without explicit approval.

These rules establish:
1. Mandatory workflow pattern for all changes
2. Minimal agent set to prevent over-agenting and role overlap

User should manually add these lines to CLAUDE.md after line 298.
