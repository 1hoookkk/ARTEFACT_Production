# Emergency Stability Configuration Status

## Date/Time: 2025-08-15 01:30 UTC

## PHASE 1: Emergency Safety Configuration ✅ COMPLETED

### CrashToggles Emergency Settings Applied:
- `ENABLE_CANVAS_COMPONENT = false` - CanvasComponent completely disabled
- `ENABLE_EDITOR_TIMERS = false` - All editor timers disabled 
- `ENABLE_TEXTURE_LOADING = false` - Asset/texture loading disabled
- `ENABLE_COMPLEX_UI = false` - Complex UI components disabled
- `ENABLE_PAINT_QUEUE = true` - RT-safe paint queue still enabled
- `ENABLE_SPECTRAL_SYNTHESIS = true` - Core audio engine still enabled
- `ENABLE_RT_ASSERTIONS = true` - RT safety checks enabled

### Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS
- CMake configuration: SUCCESS
- Debug Standalone build: SUCCESS (warnings only, no errors)
- Build location: `C:\ARTEFACT_Production\build\SpectralCanvas_artefacts\Debug\Standalone\SpectralCanvas Pro.exe`

### Safety Implementation:
1. **PluginEditor.cpp**: Added conditional compilation for CanvasComponent
2. **Emergency UI**: Created minimal fallback label when CanvasComponent disabled
3. **Timer Safety**: Snapshot harness and editor timers disabled
4. **CanvasPanel.cpp**: Already had proper CrashToggles integration
5. **Header Updates**: Added emergencyLabel member for fallback UI

### Current State:
- Executable builds successfully
- Emergency safety mode active
- Ready for gradual component re-enablement

## NEXT PHASE: Systematic Component Re-enablement

To identify the specific crash source, gradually re-enable components:

1. **Test Current Configuration**: Verify 5+ second stable runtime
2. **Enable Editor Timers**: Set `ENABLE_EDITOR_TIMERS = true`, rebuild, test
3. **Enable CanvasComponent**: Set `ENABLE_CANVAS_COMPONENT = true`, rebuild, test
4. **Enable Other Components**: Gradually re-enable remaining features

## Build Commands Used:
```cmd
cmake -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build --config Debug --target SpectralCanvas_Standalone
```

## Emergency Recovery Status: OPERATIONAL ✅
The executable now builds and should launch without immediate segmentation fault.
