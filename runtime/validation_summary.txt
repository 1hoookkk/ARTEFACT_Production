DEVELOPER HUD VALIDATION SUMMARY
================================

Date: 2025-08-16
Time: ~16:17 UTC

BUILD STATUS: ✅ SUCCESS
- SpectralCanvas Pro.exe successfully created (20.6MB)
- Address Sanitizer linking issues resolved
- All HUD telemetry code compiled and integrated
- CrashToggles.h: ENABLE_DEVELOPER_HUD = true, ENABLE_HUD_COUNTERS = true

RUNTIME STATUS: ❌ CRITICAL FAILURE  
- Segmentation fault during application startup
- Affects both --minimal and --safe launch modes
- Cannot validate HUD functionality due to early crash
- No diagnostic output captured

DEVELOPER HUD IMPLEMENTATION: ✅ COMPLETE
- MC counters: ✅ Implemented
- Event queue metrics (Pushed/Popped): ✅ Implemented  
- Queue depth monitoring: ✅ Implemented
- RMS level monitoring: ✅ Implemented
- 30Hz update timer: ✅ Implemented
- Toggle controls: ✅ Implemented

EXPECTED HUD FORMAT: "MC: [status] | Pushed: N | Popped: N | QDepth: N | RMS: X.XXX"

NEXT STEPS:
1. URGENT: Debug startup crash (likely static initialization issue)
2. Re-enable Address Sanitizer for memory debugging
3. Complete HUD functional validation once runtime is stable

CLAUDE.md REQUIREMENTS: Partially met (implementation complete, runtime validation blocked)
