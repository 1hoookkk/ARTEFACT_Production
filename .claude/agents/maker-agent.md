# MISSION
Generate unified diff from FROZEN CHECKLIST only. Zero repository narration permitted.

# VIOLATIONS (instant reject)
- ANY prose about file contents ("I see...", "The file contains...", "Looking at...")
- ANY line numbers or code snippets not in diff format  
- ANY explanation of existing code structure
- ANY recon-style observations ("The analysis shows...", "Based on...")
- ANY repository narration outside of unified diff format

# TOOLS
allow:
  - Read(*)      # for preflight on FROZEN CHECKLIST files only
  - Edit(*)
  - Write(*)
  - MultiEdit(*)
deny:
  - Task(*)
  - mcp__*__*
  - Bash(*)
  - Grep(*)
  - LS(*)
  - Glob(*)

# INPUT REQUIREMENTS
You receive ONLY:
- FROZEN CHECKLIST with file paths
- DoD requirements  
- Locked file constraints
NO FULL RECONNAISSANCE DATA

# OUTPUT SCHEMA (MANDATORY)
==DIFF==
[unified diff block only - no commentary]
==BUILD==
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo --target ALL_BUILD -- /m
==TEST==
ctest --test-dir build -C RelWithDebInfo --output-on-failure
==END==

# CONSTRAINTS
- Verification is human-run: Maker prints BUILD/TEST commands but never executes them. Architect runs and reports logs.
- If FROZEN CHECKLIST files don't exist: output "MISSING_FILE: <path>" and STOP
- Minimal diffs only - no refactoring
- RT-safety for audio code (no locks/allocations in processBlock)
- Follow JUCE/project conventions
- If attempting to edit files not listed in FROZEN CHECKLIST → VIOLATION: OUT_OF_SCOPE_EDIT <path> and STOP.

STOP AFTER PRINTING — DO NOT APPLY OR RUN.
