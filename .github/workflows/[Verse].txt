[Verse]
I ain't painting on my nails and puttin' on no purse
Ain't wearing Hellstar, puttin' God first
Dickie overalls look like I'm finna work
It don't matter where I go, all these girls flirt
Do my own shit, everybody think I'm cool
Got more women than an all-girl's school
Monte Carlo in the back lookin' like a pool
'85 outside shining like a jewel
Everybody 'round me say they need another song
Labels call me every day, hiding from my phone
Most of the time, Mexiko, I be at home
I be prayin' hard every time I be alone
No nine to five, nigga, I need a 95
Went to get a job, got denied when I tried
383 stroker, I put it in my ride
Dope boy ra, loaded dice when I slide
Wake up, pray, finna start the day
Brush my teeth, wash my hands, then I wash my face
Throw my clothes on, cleaning up my space
Before I walk out the house, I'm lifting up some weight
Fell back on drinking, nigga, now I'm getting sharper
Third day in, I've done started moving smarter
Got off track, had to go harder
Cause I ain't tryna' fuck around and be back on no Marta

Fell back on Cognac, got my eyes a little wider
In the morning, drinkin' baking soda, apple cider
First day, couldn't sleep, pulled a all-nighter
I ain't worried 'bout that shit 'cause, Mexiko, he a fighter
Sayin', "Dro ho," pussy nigga, watch yo' lips
I don't listen to no nigga with no French tips
Money first, complete the work, nigga, then I dip
Stacked a quarter ticket last time I took a trip
Take a look around, Mexiko, you know you blessed
Still in this shit, you ain't end up like the rest
Just a couple years ago, Dro life a mess
I be goin' through it, but I still passed the test
I ain't doin' all that punk-ass shit to go viral
Bitch-ass nigga cryin' like he on his cycle
I be on my own grass, I ain't got no rivalry
Every car I buy, Mexiko obtain the title
I got a crib where I lay my head at
Knowin' that I'm blessed 'cause of where my bed at
Down in my kitchen where I got my meals stacked
Tryna stop kushin', Mexiko, I smell that
2025, upgrade, elevate
Finna get out my comfort zone, out the state
Walkin' out this show when I heard she said, "Wait"
I'm on a mission, I ain't lookin' for no date

Last time I did it on my own, hit a wall
Hard-headed stupid shit, I thought I knew it all
God, he was there every time when I called
Sent me some angels when my '85 stalled
Booby traps all around
Whole lotta eyes around my house, where I stay
Livin' life blind 'cause I got a lot of faith
I was goin' through it but I knew that I was straight
I got one goal, nigga: "get rich"
Attitude positive nigga, I ain’t no bitch
Shawty want some money, told her "no," threw a fit
Takin' care of grown women, that ain't on my list
Then I started drinking, I was walkin' down my hall
I be paranoid, you won't catch me in my drawls
Stackin' up this money, I ain't goin' to no mall
Still hangin' on Mexiko if you was to fall
Fell back on Congac, now I'm drinkin' wine
I be cuttin' up and down 285
I don't put no 87 in when I ride
Been hit up BP, E85
New this shit was comin’ 'cause, nigga, I got hope
Drinkin' all this liquor like a viking, how I cope
Workin' on my '85, nigga, with my folks
Got my hands dirty, I don't wear no clear coat


Sittin' at the house making beats and drinking liquor
I be by myself a lot 'cause it be hard to trust you niggas
Found out we playing spades, I think my cards lil' bigger
He ain't gang, yeah
They said, "This shit was hard", but ain't no quitter
Sittin' at the house making beats and drinking liquor
I be by myself a lot 'cause it be hard to trust you niggas
Found out we playing spades, I think my cards lil' bigger
He ain't gang, yeah
They said, "This shit was hard", but ain't no quitter

[Verse]
Master bedroom in the dark, that's where I think a lot
Think I'm traumatized, nigga, 'cause I can drink a lot
Bud Light Platinum, Mexiko was even taking shots
I was 15 tryna sell my daddy green dots
I got out at 13, then I dropped the bеat
It's a long shot but that shit done put me on my feet
I been stacking up my money, niggas starving for somе weeks
Praying retail pays, then I'm getting up out these sheets

[Chorus]
Sittin' at the house making beats and drinking liquor
I be by myself a lot 'cause it be hard to trust you niggas
Found out we playing spades, I think my cards lil' bigger
He ain't gang, yeah
They said, "This shit was hard", but ain't no quitter
Sittin' at the house making beats and drinking liquor
I be by myself a lot 'cause it be hard to trust you niggas
Found out we playing spades, I think my cards lil' bigger
He ain't gang, yeah
They said, "This shit was hard", but ain't no quitter

Made a song, chill a lil bit, then I'm back at home
I ain't tryna hang out, we got bills and we grown
Went the hard way, Mexiko ain't takin out no loan
You ain't serious bout yo business around me, I don't condone
Made a song, chill a lil bit, then I'm back at home
I ain't tryna hang out, we got bills and we grown
Went the hard way, Mexiko ain't takin out no loan
You ain't serious bout yo business around me, I don't condone

[Verse]
I done did a 1080, Mexiko we ain't in court
You don't fuck with me, girl, you just like the way I look
Roll up and pray, push ups, and I read a book
I got salmon and some scallops, for my dogs, when I cook
Stopped doing drugs, found out I like to be alert
It wasn't hard at first, then it made my feelings hurt
Got my shit together, nigga, and, it was tough work
Nowadays, I got loafers, and I'm tucking in my shirt

[Chorus]
Made a song, chill a lil bit, then I'm back at home
I ain't tryna hang out, we got bills and we grown
Went the hard way, Mexiko ain't takin out no loan
You ain't serious bout yo business around me, I don't condone
Made a song, chill a lil bit, then I'm back at home
I ain't tryna hang out, we got bills and we grown
Went the hard way, Mexiko ain't takin out no loan
You ain't serious bout yo business around me, I don't condone
